## The Problem
Millions of people encounter scams every day. These scams can look convincing, and no one is completely immune to them. There are many different kinds of scams out there, such as phishing, viruses, fraud, hacking, and impersonation, so it can be hard to keep track and stay informed of each method.

## The Solution  
To combat these many methods of scams, we've designed a suite of anti-scam software that specializes in detecting, notifying, and educating the user about scams as they happen.  

## Features  
**Scam Blocking:** Alert the user of scams as they are detected

**Education/Resources:** Teach the user about specific scams as they arise

**Customizable Settings:** Adjust settings to suit the user's preferences

**Password Security:** Allow the user to test passwords for security, and set minimum standards for the security level of passwords on the device
